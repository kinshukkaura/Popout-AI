# ST449 - Artificial Intelligence: Project (2022, MT)

### Overall objective

This project is intended to i) assess your overall knowledge related to AI, specifically the concepts and techniques discussed during our lectures and seminars, ii) give you the opportunity to design an AI application on a topic of your choice, and iii) allow you to work as a data science team.

### Instructions

1. **GROUPS**: This is a group project, with 3-4 students. The group is expected to design a solid solution for a particular application, with each member engaged uniformly (it is your responsability to make sure that everybody is working towards the goal). If you need to find someone else to form a group with you, check our [Excel sheet](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/Jn1-qn9885hqyu56xLJKgxu2/) and contact your prospective teammates.

2. **TOPIC, SOFTWARE, DATA**: Choose a topic for which you want to design an AI application. Make sure to identify good research questions and contributions that you can address. You can pick one of the following 

    - reproduce a given study, based on a set of research papers, and add your own contributions and findings, 
    - design an AI-based application for a particular problem and compare your approach to existing approaches for solving this problem.

    You can rely on existing software or library. There is no expectation that you will design a completely new approach, but you are supposed to show a good understanding and mastery of the techniques you chose, to propose potential improvements, and to discuss in detail their performance. 

    Make sure you can identify a consistent set of real data to use in your application. You can also generate synthetic data in case you don't find real data. Also, you can use any existing dataset(s) and import these data into your application. Have a clear understanding of the data and use data of good quality/completeness. There is no need to investigate huge amount of data or very complex environments, but make sure you have a decent amount of data that allows your agent(s) to train, test and validate hypotheses, or make consistent inference to solve the problem.

3. **WRITING**:
Writing a paper in data science follows a 'standard' protocol. Familiarize yourself with the writing etiquette---if you have not yet done so---and apply it in your project report. Probably the most time-efficient way to absorb this style are works which obtained best paper award or chosen to be oral presentation at top-tier conference venues ([NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), [ICML](https://icml.cc/), [AISTATS](https://aistats.org/aistats2023/), [UAI](https://www.auai.org/uai2022/)) or were published in [JMLR](https://jmlr.org/). Select a few past publications with this in mind, and observe how the authors

    1. justify the importance and challenges of the topic,
    2. review related existing work in the literature, identify their shortcomings, and motivate the proposed solution,
    3. summarize compactly their contributions and novelty,
    4. make the document self-contained in terms of notations and definitions,
    5. formulate the problem mathematically,
    6. describe their solution, discuss the computational complexity,
    7. present their benchmarks and preprocessing, detail the performance measures used, design and discuss in detail the experiments, compare with       alternative methods,
    8. point to the limitations of the work and motivate future research directions.

    The structure of the paper should be:

    - Introduction (bullet points i - ii - iii)
    - Problem Formulation (iv - v)
    - Proposed Solution (vi)
    - Numerical Experiments (vii)
    - Conclusions (viii)

### Deliverables

Your **solution** `MUST` contain:

* a PDF document with 

    - LSE candidate numbers (**no name please**),
    - covering the points detailed under **WRITING**, 
    - with the guide in **TOPIC, SOFTWARE, DATA**. 

    Reports should be written in [JMLR style](./TeX_template.zip) and are restricted to **9 content pages** (including figures and tables), followed by     arbitrary number of pages containing references. The "template" folder contains both a minimal example (directory ‘small’) and a larger example (directory ‘large’). The template style of both directories is the same, but the "large" version contains more examples on how to write formulas, include figures and tables. Both folder are accompanied with a .bib file to help you using a unified style for references. Do not alter the document style (such as font size, font type, margins, …). Your report/study should be well-structured, to-the-point, self-contained and reproducible.
* any code and data used in your project. Code should come as .ipynb file that can be run on Google Colab. Remember to upload (or give a pointer) to any datasets used in the code.

### Submission

The submission should be done via GitHub and Moodle, as for the previous assignments. Remember that this is a **2-step submission process**, and **both** steps must be completed **before the deadline**: 

* submit a PDF file with all your answers on the GitHub repository that was automatically created when you clicked on the assignment link. Please, make sure not to use any other repository.
* submit the link to your GitHub repository through [Moodle](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=1129316) (on Moodle, you can submit a .doc or .pdf file with your GitHub link on it).

### Important dates (meant in London time)

* Assignment released: 02/12/2022, 5pm
* Suggestions of project proposals via [form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/-+QDh9CdXYU5BMRycZLeppkMkmKydhUNBTvT4yVRokQ/) and approval of projects (by Zoltan): between 02/12/2022 and 09/12/2022. You are welcome to submit your project proposal as soon as it is ready to minimize delays.
* Submission of solution: 09/01/2023, 5 pm
* Feedback and grade (provisional): 10/02/2023, 10 pm

### Marking criteria

* This assignment is worth 80% of the final grade.
* **IMPORTANT**: according to the School policy, you **must** submit an answer to this assignment; otherwise, you will be graded 0 (zero).

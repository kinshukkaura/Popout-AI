## Artificial Intelligence Project (2022) - Reinforcement Learning agent for Popout4.
 PopOut is a variant of the game Connect4. It is played on a vertical two-dimensional board. The standard board size has
seven columns and each column consists of six cells. Two players take turns and at each
turn, the player to move can make one of two types of moves: drop a new disk, or pop
an existing bottom disk of his own color. When dropping a new disk, the disk falls
down as much as it can due to gravity. When popping a disk, all disks above the
removed one fall down. At any point, gravity ensures that there can be no gaps in any of
the columns. The aim of the game is to create a four-in-row, i.e. at least four disks of the
same color arranged horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 

You can play the game by running the python file, the board is represented by an array, with the numbers in the array corresponding to the player who placed that disc.

### Reinforcement Learning 
Algorithms SARSA and Q-learning are utilised to create agents that you can play with, and can play each other. Notebook allows you to create simulations for the agent to train, and then play with the trained agent.
